## Example
Registering routes is analagous to how this is done within **Express.js**.

```coffeescript
Server.get '*', (req, res) ->
      false # False to continue ("not handled").


Server.get '/server/send/404', (req, res) -> res.send 404
Server.get '/server/send/404-not-found', (req, res) -> res.send 404, 'Sorry, not found.'
Server.get '/server/send/html', (req, res) -> res.send "<h1>Some HTML</h1>"
Server.get '/server/send/json', (req, res) -> res.send { foo:'json' }



Server.get '/server/render/jade/:id', (req, res) ->
  file = 'path/to/html.jade'
  title = "My Title - #{ req.params.id }"
  res.render file, { pageTitle:title, youAreUsingJade:true }



Server.get '/server/render/css/:sheet', (req, res) ->
  file = "path/to/css/#{ req.params.sheet }.styl"
  res.render(file)

```
